# Automated Timetable Scheduling System

## User Manual for Time-table Automation System

### 1. Overview

The Time-table Automation System is a command-line Python application designed to automate the scheduling of courses for academic sessions at a university. It processes course data, assigns rooms, schedules lectures, tutorials, and labs while avoiding conflicts (e.g., professor and room conflicts), and accounts for break times (morning and lunch breaks). The system generates timetables for each department-semester combination and outputs them to an Excel file (`timetable_all_departments.xlsx`). It also identifies and reports unscheduled courses in `unscheduled_courses.xlsx` and generates faculty schedules in `all_faculty_timetables.xlsx`.

This manual provides instructions for downloading, setting up, and using the system, along with usage scenarios, requirements satisfied, future work, and FAQs.
